    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh Cranberries: Opt for fresh cranberries that are firm, plump, and blemish-free. Lighter colored cranberries are best for sauce, as they contain more pectin and result in a thicker consistency.</li>
        <li>Sugar: White sugar does more than add sweetness to classic cranberry sauce: It also absorbs liquid and, when heated, thickens the sauce.</li>
        <li>Orange Juice: All cranberry sauce starts with a liquid base. If you don't like orange juice, you can substitute pomegranate juice or even red wine.</li>
    </ul>
